## Description
Allows for an employee to keep track of events that are occurring throughout their workday. Timeblocks are color-coded based upon whether or not the hour is in the past, present, or future. Events that are saved by the user are stored in `localStorage` to allow the user to close out of the application as necessary. 

## Process
I began this project by creating the basic structure of the application with Bootstrap. After that, I decided to tackle all of the time-based functionality via Moment.js. I then began to work on the user input and save button features - with help from jQuery. Last but not least, I worked on saving the user inputs to `localStorage` so that the application would save any events the user put in to a time block. 

## Reflection
To date, this is the project that I found to be the most interesting. With that being said, I believe that I made the process more difficult than it probably needed to be. I jumped in without a plan, to be quite honest, and it ended up making life a little more diffcult towards the end when I was trying to get and pull things from `localStorage`. Third party API's are a wonderful thing (especially Bootstrap), and I can't wait to use them some more, though I did learn this lesson: ALWAYS PLAN AHEAD.
